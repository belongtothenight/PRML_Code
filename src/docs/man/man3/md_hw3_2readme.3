 There are two methods included in here\&.
.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fC\&./gen_shape\&.gp\fP to produce hard coded shapes\&. Execute with \fCgnuplot \&./gen_shape\&.gp\fP\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fC\&./main\&.c\fP which is coded as CLI tool to take CSV coordinate pair as input\&. Execute with \fC\&./src/script/runner\&.ps1 -p hw3-all\fP\&.

.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fC\&./dataset\fP: coordinate of original shapes\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fC\&./lib\fP: libraries files for c code\&.
.IP "3." 4
\fC\&./output\fP: output images and data files (not included) generated from c program and \fCgen_shape\&.gp\fP\&.
.IP "4." 4
\fC\&./CMakeLists\&.txt\fP: CMake sub-directory settings for hw3, need to be built from \fC\&./src/CMakeLists\&.txt\fP\&.
.IP "5." 4
\fC\&./gen_shape\&.gp\fP: seperate program with c, generate images with user input coordinates\&.
.IP "6." 4
\fC\&./main\&.c\fP: entry point of c program in hw3\&.
.IP "7." 4
\fC\&./readme\&.md\fP: this file you see\&.
.PP
.SH "Problems"
.PP
.IP "1." 4
It is unnecessary to keep opening and closing GNUPlot pipes\&.
.IP "2." 4
Can't auto detect shapes category even if they looks the same on image\&. (currently: coordinate concatenated string hashing string)
